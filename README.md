# Antoni López Giménez's portfolio repository
JULY '23 UPDATE
> Currently, the repository is public and  under creation.

Purpose
> The purpose of this repository is to create a digital portfolio with all the code and documentation created by myself. Everything was born during the Python course by Brais Moure and the desire to grow professionally. My goal is to be able to share all my work as a developer in an easy and friendly way.
